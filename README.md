## Hi,

I'm an high-spirited learner based in Indonesia, having a good time getting my hand wet in web development. Currently I am interested in data visualization and building some interactive interface on them. In this page I would like to share some projects I've been building these past months. I hope you like it. 

1. [Covid19](https://hariswb.com/covid19) ([repo](https://github.com/hariswb/covid19))

2. [Genetic Algorithm of Community Detection](https://github.com/hariswb/ga-community-detection)
