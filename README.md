## Welcome!

Hi, I'm a constant learner having a good time getting my way into web development. In case you want to know about what i've been doing, consider opening my page on [hariwb.com](http://hariswb.com) or browse through my repos: 

1. Covid 19 Dashboard build with react and d3 [covid19](https://github.com/hariswb/covid19)
2. A little script for graph community detection using genetic algorithm [ga-comm](https://github.com/hariswb/ga-community-detection)
