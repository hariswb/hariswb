## Hi,

I'm an high-spirited learner based in Indonesia, having a good time getting my hand wet in web development. Currently I am interested in data visualization and building some interactive interface on them. In this page I would like to share some projects I've been building these past months. I hope you like it. I would be happy if you drop a comment or critic on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/khalayakumum).
