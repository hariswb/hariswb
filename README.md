## Hi,

I'm a junior software engineer based in Indonesia. I currently work at nubela.co. I like to work with data. Last year, I build data visualization apps where you can check [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/SSAKGvudJEkUjlZLjDRTKC/hariswb-portfolio-2022?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1). In my current workplace, we build data-driven application and I'm really into this topic and would like to explore further. This year (2022) my resolution outside of work is to contribute more in open source projects.
